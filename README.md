ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandro, a developer interested in front-end and data science.

Currently I'm working at FluidAttacks, a cyber security company, as security developer, contributing to the development of an automated tool to search deterministic vulnerabilities in the source code. 

I have experience working with Javascript and Python, using frameworks such as React and Flask.

I am passionate about front end development and design, and all things regarding data. 

Recently, I have taken a deep interest in using dash to develop web applications. 

I'm a self taught developer, with certifications such as DS4A Cohort 6 and Data Science from Coder House. 
Currently, I'm studying a full-stack bootcamp at fullstackopen.com/
