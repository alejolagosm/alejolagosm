ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandro Lagos, a Colombian Civil Engineer by trade looking to reinvent myself by getting into the tech world.

Iâ€™m interested in front end development and Data Analysis/ Data science projects and currently open to all kinds of job opportunities in those fields.

Iâ€™m currently learning JS frameworks (Mainly React and VueJS) and ML algorithms in Python. 
I have competent knowledge and practice in front end development using HTML, CSS (Or SCSS, Bootstrap, among others) and of course, Vanilla JS.
I have also previously worked on some Data Analysis projects using Python.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project related to web development (not necessarily related to those two fields), because I believe my main strengths are to be adaptable and resourceful.
