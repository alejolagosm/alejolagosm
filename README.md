ðŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Alejandro Lagos, a Colombian Civil Engineer by trade looking to reinvent myself by getting into the tech world.

Iâ€™m interested in front end development and Data Analysis/Data science projects and currently open to all kinds of job opportunities in those fields.

Iâ€™m currently learning React and Data Science. 
I have competent knowledge and practice in front end development using HTML, CSS frameworks and of course, Vanilla JS. 

In data analysis and data science, I have knowledge in cleaning and analysing data and some basic machine learning models.

Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on any project related to web development.
